## Installation

For basic out-of-the-box use of the theme, follow the [Omeka Classic User Manual instructions for installing themes](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Admin/Appearance/Themes/#installing-a-theme). 

For more advanced use, such as customizing the theme with Sass, you'll need to install the tools with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater). Navigate to your theme directory and run `npm install`.

## Theme Configuration

* **Stylesheet**: The theme provides 4 style options.
  * **Default** uses ZURB Foundation's default styles for prototyping, which are all viewable in their documentation under the [Kitchen Sink](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/kitchen-sink.html).
  * **Revolution** aims to capture the feel of old documents and juxtaposes it with a bright red accent. It includes a textured paper background image.
  * **Sea Foam** offers a clean, friendly look with a teal palette.
  * **Inkwell** features a high contrast serif family for its typography, as well as sunny yellow accents.
* **Navigation layouts**: Global navigation can display as a **horizontal top bar with optional dropdown menus** or a **left vertical column**.
* **Show Top Navigation Child Pages**: Toggle display of child pages within the main navigation.
* **Logo**: Upload an image asset to use as a logo in place of a text site title.
* **Footer Content**: Control what appears in the footer. This field takes HTML markup.
* **Layout for Browse Pages**: Select how to display items within their "browse" views.
  * **Grid**: Items are organized into rows and columns. This is recommended for items that prominently feature images.
  * **List**: Items are stacked into a single column.
  * **Toggle (default: grid)**: Site visitors can choose to display the browse views as grids or lists, and grids are the default.
  * **Toggle (default: list)**: Site visitors can choose to display the browse views as grids or lists, and lists are the default.
* **Layout for Show Pages**: Resource metadata can show display as **stacked** with properties as headings above their values, or **inline** with properties as headings inline with their values.

## Customizing the Theme

For those dipping their toes into customizing sites with CSS, the [CSS Editor](https://omeka.org/classic/plugins/CSSEditor/) module allows site administrators to write style overrides.

For advanced CSS and Sass users, Foundation S uses ZURB Foundation Site's toolkit that includes variables and mixins for managing and extending many styles.

### Sass Tasks

Run these commands within the theme's root directory.

* **npm start**: While this task runs, it watches for changes to sass files and recompiles the CSS.
* **gulp sass**: This is the one-off task for compiling the current Sass/CSS.

### Sass File Structure

Foundation S comes with the Default theme, as well as 3 other customized stylesheets that were built on top of Default. The "Sea Foam" theme has the fewest overrides and is thus the easiest reference for a custom theme model.

**/asset/sass/seafoam.scss**

```
@charset 'utf-8';

@import 'globals-default';
@import 'globals-seafoam';
@import 'settings';

// Sea Foam Settings

$topbar-background: $primary-color;
  
$thumbnail-border: 4px solid $secondary-color;
$thumbnail-shadow: none;
$thumbnail-shadow-hover: 0 0 6px 1px rgba($primary-color, 0.5);

$button-background: $secondary-color;
$button-color: $primary-color;

@import 'foundation-core';
@import 'omeka';

header a {
  color: $white;
}
```

Much of the customizability within the theme lies in managing its settings variables. ZURB Foundation's default global variables from their original `_settings.scss` all sit in `_globals-default.scss`. Many of these variables are used throughout the rest of `_settings.scss`, so it was necessary to separate them out into their own file if the theme writer wants to set their own global variables. Here all the overrides live in `_globals-seafoam.scss`, and so all overridden values will be appropriately updated for use throughout the rest of `_settings.scss`. 

Any non-global setting variable overrides should come after the import for `_settings.scss` and before their usagee in the rule files, `_foundation-core.scss`, and `_omeka.scss`. 

ZURB Foundation's default style rules are all managed in `_foundation-core.scss`. All style rules specific to Omeka S are contained within `_omeka.scss`.

After all those imports come all style rules specific to the theme.
